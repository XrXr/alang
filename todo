 √ refactor ir for better pruning (no more type switching) @done (18-02-19 13:48)
 √ support types of different sizes. Right now pointers to u8 are broken for example @done (18-02-22 20:47)
 √ proper [] operatator @done (18-02-23 13:37)
 x tokenizer should break up spaces better. Search for todo in parse_expression.go @cancelled (18-02-23 13:44)
 √ can't loop and use var to access array @done (18-04-18 20:44)
 ✔ return values @done (18-06-11 20:23)
 ✔ continues/breaks @done (18-06-11 20:23)
 ☐ ensureVarInRegister should take multiple arguments and make sure it doesn't swap a var that it just brought into a register
 ☐ :morecopies copying full structs
 ✔ factor out signExtendToMatchSize @done (18-06-19 20:07)
 ☐ do some reserach about signedModulous -- how do we do s32 *= s64? what if on the right side the sign bit is set?
 ☐ we need a print_signed_int
 ☐ proc argument type checking
 ☐ proc overloading?
 ✔ complex expressions like if (rettrue() && retfalse() == false) @done (18-06-11 20:24)
 □ increment/decrement
 ✔ better typing for numbers. There is a hack in place for assigning an int to u8 atm @done (18-06-16 00:41)
 □ the whole Unresolved type situation
   ✔ procs that take parameters which reference structs -- they are left as unresolved type for now @done (18-06-11 20:25)
   □ can't have array of structs/array of pointer to structs in your struct
   ☐ can't do var foo *somestruct
 ✔ better pruning @done (18-06-15 19:55)
 ☐ unsigned numbers
 □ error reporting
   □ parse errors: binary operators missing operands ("i++" parses atm)
 □ type casting
