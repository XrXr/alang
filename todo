 x tokenizer should break up spaces better. Search for todo in parse_expression.go @cancelled (18-02-23 13:44)
 □ return values
 □ better typing for numbers. There is a hack in place for assigning an int to u8 atm
 □ the whole Unresolved type situation
   □ procs that take parameters which reference structs -- they are left as unresolved type for now
   □ can't have array of structs/array of pointer to structs in your struct
 □ continues/breaks
 □ better pruning
 □ error reporting
   □ parse errors: binary operators missing operands ("i++" parses atm)
 □ type casting
