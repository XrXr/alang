 √ refactor ir for better pruning (no more type switching) @done (18-02-19 13:48)
 □ support types of different sizes. Right now pointers to u8 are broken for example
 □ proper [] operatator
 □ tokenizer should break up spaces better. Search for todo in parse_expression.go
 □ type casting
 □ return values
 □ better typing for numbers. There is a hack in place for assigning an int to u8 atm
 □ the whole Unresolved type situation
   □ procs that take parameters which reference structs -- they are left as unresolved type for now
   □ can't have array of structs/array of pointer to structs in your struct
 □ continues/breaks
 □ better pruning
 □ error reporting
   □ parse errors: binary operators missing operands ("i++" parses atm)
